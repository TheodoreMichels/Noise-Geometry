Morphing 3D Geometry with Procedural Noise Functions

A relatively simple experiment in generative 3D visuals.

Essentially, a 3D mesh is warped with a procedural noise function. Several geometry controls are provided through a simple interface, and bloom and frame blending post-processing controls are included as well.
